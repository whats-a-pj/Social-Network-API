## Description

A database structure for a social network. This application does not have a front-end set up but you can see the functionality of it working in my walkthrough video!
This application was built to show what a strong backend looks like for a social network by creating a simple & easy way to communicate and interact with one another. This uses a MongoDB/Mongoose database structure and Express for routing.

Users with coding experience as well as experience with MongoDB can clone this repo and update the models to tailor this simple backend to their personal needs.
